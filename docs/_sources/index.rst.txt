1D Density Functional Theory Solver
===================================

This is a python based 1D Density Functional Theory Software package.
    It is used for solving problems in a single dimension, also called "One-D".
    What gets confusing is that its for solving DFT problems, (Adding a second D).
    This is not, however, a 2D solver despite being solving 1DDFT problems.
